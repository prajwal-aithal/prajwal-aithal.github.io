<h5><b>About Me</b></h5>
<p>I am Prajwal A N, a software engineer by profession, explorer by passion.</p>

<p><b>Motto</b>: Learn, grow and mentor.</p>

<p><b>Work</b>: Site Reliability Engineer at Google Ireland developing next-generation ML inference systems for Ads@Google. Before Google, was at Samsung Korea developing resource management in the Tizen OS. Check my <b><a href="http://in.linkedin.com/in/prajwalaithal" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></b> profile for more.</p>

<p><b>Passion</b>: I like reading up on cognitive processes, mental models, philosophy, and inspiring autobiographies (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/prajwal_an">Goodreads</a>). I find the human physiology and the human brain very interesting, and have recently started exploring these topics. Apart from these, I enjoy long walks, playing the violin, ultra-cycling, and hiking (two things I picked up during my stay in South Korea).</p>

<p><b>This site</b>: I write (occasionally) about my learnings, and other topics I find interesting (<a href="/tags.html">list<a>).</p>
