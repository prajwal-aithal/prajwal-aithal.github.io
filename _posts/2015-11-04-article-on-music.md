I wrote an article for the blog of
[Association of IIT Alumni South Korea](http://iitalumkorea.com "Association of IIT Alumni, South Korea"), 
about the basics of Indian classical music. 
This article was written to introduce people to the basic concepts of music in 
general and the intricacies of Indian classical music in particular.
